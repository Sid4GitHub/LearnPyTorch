    "Large language model A large language model (LLM) is a language model trained with self-supervised machine learning on a vast amount of text, designed for natural language processing tasks, especially language generation.\n",
    "The largest and most capable LLMs are generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), which are largely used in generative chatbots such as ChatGPT, Gemini or Claude. \n",
    "LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. \n",
    "These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in. \n",
    "Before the emergence of transformer-based models in 2017, some language models were considered large relative to the computational and data constraints of their time. \n",
    "In the early 1990s, IBM's statistical models pioneered word alignment techniques for machine translation, laying the groundwork for corpus-based language modeling. \n",
    "A smoothed n-gram model in 2001, such as those employing Kneser-Ney smoothing, trained on 300 million words achieved state-of-the-art perplexity on benchmark tests at the time. \n",
    "During the 2000s, with the rise of widespread internet access, researchers began compiling massive text datasets from the web (\"web as corpus\"  to train statistical language models.  \n",
    "Following the breakthrough of deep neural networks in image classification around 2012, similar architectures were adapted for language tasks. \n",
    "This shift was marked by the development of word embeddings (eg, Word2Vec by Mikolov in 2013) and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models using LSTM. \n",
    "In 2016, Google transitioned its translation service to neural machine translation (NMT), replacing statistical phrase-based models with deep recurrent neural networks. \n",
    "These early NMT systems used LSTM-based encoder-decoder architectures, as they preceded the invention of transformers.\n",
    "At the 2017 NeurIPS conference, Google researchers introduced the transformer architecture in their landmark paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". \n",
    "This paper's goal was to improve upon 2014 seq2seq technology, and was based mainly on the attention mechanism developed by Bahdanau et al in 2014. \n",
    "The following year in 2018, BERT was introduced and quickly became \"ubiquitous\".  \n",
    "Though the original transformer has both encoder and decoder blocks, BERT is an encoder-only model. \n",
    "Academic and research usage of BERT began to decline in 2023, following rapid improvements in the abilities of decoder-only models (such as GPT) to solve tasks via prompting. \n",
    "History The training compute of notable large AI models in FLOPs vs publication date over\n",
    "the period 2017–2024. \n",
    "The majority of large models are language models or multimodal models with language capacity.\n",
    "An illustration of main components of the transformer model from the original paper, where layers were\n",
    "normalized after (instead of before) multiheaded attention\n",
    "Although decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI claimed to have initially deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use. \n",
    "GPT-3 in 2020 went a step further and as of 2025 is available only via API with no offering of downloading the model to execute locally. \n",
    "But it was the 2022 consumer-facing chatbot ChatGPT that received extensive media coverage and public attention. \n",
    "The 2023 GPT-4 was praised for its increased accuracy and as a \"holy grail\" for its multimodal capabilities. \n",
    "OpenAI did not reveal the high-level architecture and the number of parameters of GPT-4. \n",
    "The release of ChatGPT led to an uptick in LLM usage across several research subfields of computer science, including robotics, software engineering, and societal impact work. \n",
    "In 2024 OpenAI released the reasoning model OpenAI o1, which generates long chains of thought before returning a final answer. \n",
    "Many LLMs with parameter counts comparable to those of OpenAI's GPT series have been developed.  \n",
    "Since 2022, source-available models have been gaining popularity, especially at first with BLOOM and LLaMA, though both have restrictions on the field of use. \n",
    "Mistral AI's models Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7b have the more permissive Apache License. In January 2025, DeepSeek released DeepSeek R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight model that performs comparably to OpenAI o1 but at a much lower cost. \n",
    "Since 2023, many LLMs have been trained to be multimodal, having the ability to also process or generate other types of data, such as images or audio. \n",
    "These LLMs are also called large multimodal models (LMMs).  As of 2024, the largest and most capable models are all based on the transformer architecture. \n",
    "Some recent implementations are based on other architectures, such as recurrent neural network variants and\n",
    "Mamba (a state space model).    \n",
    "Dataset preprocessing Tokenization As machine learning algorithms process numbers rather than text, the text must be converted to numbers.\n",
    "In the first step, a vocabulary is decided upon, then integer indices are arbitrarily but uniquely assigned to each vocabulary entry, and finally, an embedding is associated to the integer index. \n",
    "Algorithms include byte-pair encoding (BPE) and WordPiece. \n",
    "There are also special tokens serving as control characters, such as  (\"unknown\") for characters not appearing in the vocabulary. \n",
    "Also, some special symbols are used to denote special text formatting. \n",
    "For example, \"Ġ\" denotes a preceding whitespace in RoBERTa and GPT. \n",
    "\"##\" denotes continuation of a preceding word in BERT. \n",
    "For example, the BPE tokenizer used by GPT-3 (Legacy) would split tokenizer: texts -> series of numerical \"tokens\" as tokenizer: texts ->series of numerical \"tokens\" Tokenization also compresses the datasets. \n",
    "Because LLMs generally require input to be an array that is not jagged, the shorter texts must be \"padded\" until they match the length of the longest one. \n",
    "How many tokens are, on average, needed per word depends on the language of the dataset.  \n",
    "As an example, consider a tokenizer based on byte-pair encoding. \n",
    "In the first step, all unique characters (including blanks and punctuation marks) are treated as an initial set of n-grams (i.e. initial set of uni-grams). \n",
    "Successively the most frequent pair of adjacent characters is merged into a bi-gram and all instances of the pair are replaced by it.\n",
    "All occurrences of adjacent pairs of (previously merged) n-grams that most frequently occur together are then again merged into even lengthier n-gram, until a vocabulary of prescribed size is obtained (in case of GPT-3, the size is 50257). \n",
    "After a tokenizer is trained, any text can be tokenized by it, as long as it does not contain characters not appearing in the initial-set of uni-grams. \n",
    "A token vocabulary based on the frequencies extracted from mainly English corpora uses as few tokens as\n",
    "possible for an average English word. \n",
    "However, an average word in another language encoded by such an\n",
    "English-optimized tokenizer is split into a suboptimal amount of tokens. \n",
    "GPT-2 tokenizer can use up to\n",
    "15 times more tokens per word for some languages, for example for the Shan language from Myanmar.\n",
    "Even more widespread languages such as Portuguese and German have \"a premium of 50%\" compared toEnglish. \n",
    "Greedy tokenization also causes subtle problems with text completion.\n",
    "In the context of training LLMs, datasets are typically cleaned by removing low-quality, duplicated, to oxic data. \n",
    "Cleaned datasets can increase training efficiency and lead to improved downstream performance. \n",
    "A trained LLM can be used to clean datasets for training a further LLM. \n",
    "With the increasing proportion of LLM-generated content on the web, data cleaning in the future mayinclude filtering out such content. \n",
    "LLM-generated content can pose a problem if the content is similar to human text (making filtering difficult) but of lower quality (degrading performance of models trained on BPE Problems Dataset cleaning it). \n",
    "Training of largest language models might need more linguistic data than naturally available, or that the naturally occurring data is of insufficient quality. \n",
    "In these cases, synthetic data might be used. \n",
    "Microsoft's Phi series of LLMs is trained on textbook-like data generated by another LLM. \n",
    "An LLM is a type of foundation model (large X model) trained on language. LLMs can be trained in different ways. \n",
    "In particular, GPT models are first pretrained to predict the next word on a large amount of data, before being fine-tuned. \n",
    "The qualifier \"large\" in \"large language model\" is inherently vague, as there is no\n",
    "definitive threshold for the number of parameters required to qualify as \"large\". \n",
    "As time goes on, what was previously considered \"large\" may evolve. \n",
    "GPT-1 of 2018 is usually considered the first LLM, even though it has only 117 million parameters. \n",
    "The tendency towards larger models is visible in the list of large language models.\n",
    "As technology advanced, large sums have been invested in increasingly large models. \n",
    "Substantial infrastructure is necessary for training the largest models. \n",
    "For example, the training of GPT-2 (i.e. a 1.5-billion-parameters model) in 2019 cost $50,000, while training of the PaLM (i.e. a 540-billion-parameters model) in 2022 cost $8 million, and Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (in 2021) cost around $11 million. \n",
    "For Transformer-based LLM, training cost is much higher than inference cost. \n",
    "It costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token, whereas it costs 1 to 2 FLOPs per parameter to infer on one token. \n",
    "Before being fine-tuned, most LLMs are next-token predictors. \n",
    "The fine-tuning can make LLM adopt a conversational format where they play the role of the assistant. \n",
    "Techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or constitutional AI can be used to instill human preferences and make LLMs more \"helpful, honest, and harmless\".  \n",
    "In 2021, Google Research released FLAN, a new model fine-tuned to follow a wide range of instructions. It could perform a task given a verbal instruction without needing any examples. \n",
    "In 2022, OpenAI demonstrated InstructGPT, a version of GPT-3.5 similarly fine-tuned to follow instructions. \n",
    "Instead of completing the sentence (e.g. following the instruction \"Write an essay about the main themes represented in Hamlet\" with \"If you submit the essay after March 17, your grade will be reduced by 10% for each day of delay\" based on the frequency of this textual sequence in the corpus), the instruction- following models have a preference to actually act on the instruction. \n",
    "RLHF involves training a reward model to predict which text humans prefer. \n",
    "Then, the LLM can be finetuned through reinforcement learning to better satisfy this reward model. \n",
    "Since humans typically prefer truthful, helpful and harmless answers, RLHF favors such answers. \n",
    "LLMs are generally based on the transformer architecture, which leverages an attention mechanism that enables the model to process relationships between all elements in a sequence simultaneously, regardless of their distance from each other. \n",
    "In order to find out which tokens are relevant to each other within the scope of the context window, the\n",
    "attention mechanism calculates \"soft\" weights for each token, more precisely for its embedding, by using\n",
    "multiple attention heads, each with its own \"relevance\" for calculating its own soft weights. For example,\n",
    "the small (i.e. 117M parameter sized) GPT-2 model has had twelve attention heads and a context window\n",
    "of only 1k tokens. In its medium version it has 345M parameters and contains 24 layers, each with 12\n",
    "attention heads. For the training with gradient descent a batch size of 512 was utilized. \n",
    "The largest models, such as Google's Gemini 1.5, presented in February 2024, can have a context window\n",
    "sized up to 1 million (context window of 10 million was also \"successfully tested\"). Other models\n",
    "with large context windows includes Anthropic's Claude 2.1, with a context window of up to 200k\n",
    "tokens. Note that this maximum refers to the number of input tokens and that the maximum number of\n",
    "output tokens differs from the input and is often smaller. For example, the GPT-4 Turbo model has a\n",
    "maximum output of 4096 tokens. \n",
    "Length of a conversation that the model can take into account when generating its next answer is limited\n",
    "by the size of a context window, as well. If the length of a conversation, for example with ChatGPT, is\n",
    "longer than its context window, only the parts inside the context window are taken into account when\n",
    "generating the next answer, or the model needs to apply some algorithm to summarize the too distant\n",
    "parts of conversation.\n",
    "The shortcomings of making a context window larger include higher computational cost and possibly\n",
    "diluting the focus on local context, while making it smaller can cause a model to miss an important long-\n",

    "each input to the most appropriate expert(s).\n",
    "Mixtures of experts can reduce inference costs,\n",
    "as only a fraction of the parameters are used for each input. The approach was introduced in 2017 by\n",
    "Google researchers.   \n",
    "Typically, LLMs are trained with single- or half-precision floating point numbers (float32 and float16).\n",
    "One float16 has 16 bits, or 2 bytes, and so one billion parameters require 2 gigabytes. The largest models\n",
    "typically have 100 billion parameters, requiring 200 gigabytes to load, which places them outside the\n",
    "range of most consumer electronics. \n",
    "Post-training quantization aims to decrease the space requirement by lowering precision of the\n",

    "quantization allows for the use of a different quantization codebook per layer, either a lookup table of\n",

    "Quantized models are typically seen as frozen with modification of weights (e.g. fine-tuning) only\n",
    "applied to the original model. However, it is still possible to fine-tune quantized models using low-rank\n",
    "adaptation. Furthermore, more advanced methods to reduce precision loss from quantized models also\n",
    "need a training-like step: \n",
    "Quantization-aware training (QAT, 2020) adds a representation of quantization loss to the\n",
    "training of the parent network, which can be improved using ordinary backpropagation. It is\n",
    "expensive to train but effective on a wide range of models, not only LLMs. \n",
    "GPT Quantization (GPTQ, 2022) minimizes the squared error of each layer's output given a\n",
    "limited choice of possible values for weights.\n",
    "Activation-aware quantization (AWQ, 2023) keeps the most important weights in fp16.\n",
    "Sparse-Quantized Representation (SpQR) also keeps the particularly important parameters\n",
    "(\"outlier weights\") in higher precision. \n",
    "Unsloth's \"dynamic\" method (2024), not to be confused with the dynamic quantization from\n",

    "Beyond basic text generation, various techniques have been developed to extend LLM capabilities,\n",
    "including the use of external tools and data sources, improved reasoning on complex problems, and\n",
    "enhanced instruction-following or autonomy through prompting methods.\n",
    "In 2020, OpenAI researchers demonstrated that their new model GPT-3 could understand what format to\n",
    "use given a few rounds of Q and A (or other type of task) in the input data as example, thanks in part due\n",
    "to the RLHF technique. This technique, called few-shot prompting, allows LLMs to be adapted to any\n",
    "task without requiring fine-tuning. Also in 2022, it was found that the base GPT-3 model can generate\n",
    "an instruction based on user input. The generated instruction along with user input is then used as input to\n",
    "another instance of the model under a \"Instruction: [...], Input: [...], Output:\" format. The other instance is\n",
    "able to complete the output and often produces the correct answer in doing so. The ability to \"self-\n",
    "instruct\" makes LLMs able to bootstrap themselves toward a correct answer. \n",
    "An LLM can be turned into a chatbot or a \"dialog assistant\" by specializing it for conversation. In\n",
    "essence, user input is prefixed with a marker such as \"Q:\" or \"User:\" and the LLM is asked to predict the\n",
    "output after a fixed \"A:\" or \"Assistant:\". This type of model became commercially available in 2022 with\n",

    "a chat context usually start with a few lines of overarching instructions, from a role called \"developer\" or\n",
    "\"system\" to convey a higher authority than the user's input. This is called a \"system prompt\".  \n",
    "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an approach that enhances LLMs by integrating them with\n",
    "document retrieval systems. Given a query, a document retriever is called to retrieve the most relevant\n",
    "documents. This is usually done by encoding the query and the documents into vectors, then finding the\n",
    "documents with vectors (usually stored in a vector database) most similar to the vector of the query. The\n",
    "LLM then generates an output based on both the query and context included from the retrieved\n",
    "documents. \n",
    "Tool use is a mechanism that enables LLMs to interact with external systems, applications, or data\n",
    "sources. It can allow for example to fetch real-time information from an API or to execute code. A\n",
    "program separate from the LLM watches the output stream of the LLM for a special tool-calling syntax.\n",
    "When these special tokens appear, the program calls the tool accordingly and feeds its output back into\n",
    "the LLM's input stream. \n",
    "Early tool-using LLMs were fine-tuned on the use of specific tools. But fine-tuning LLMs for the ability\n",
    "to read API documentation and call API correctly has greatly expanded the range of tools accessible to an\n",
    "LLM. Describing available tools in the system prompt can also make an LLM able to use tools. A\n",

    "An LLM only has access to the current conversation, but it can be given long-term memory as an external\n",
    "tool. Memory formation happens when the LLM calls the tool to write to the external storage. Retrieval\n",
    "can happen as a full context injected into the start of every conversation, or as another \"tool\" that is called\n",
    "on demand. The retrieval tool can be based on a simple key-value store or based on semantic search like\n",
    "retrieval-augmented generation. \n",
    "An LLM is typically not an autonomous agent by itself, as it lacks the ability to interact with dynamic\n",
    "environments, recall past behaviors, and plan future actions. But it can be transformed into an agent by\n",
    "adding supporting elements: the role (profile) and the surrounding environment of an agent can be\n",
    "additional inputs to the LLM, while memory can be integrated as a tool or provided as additional input.\n",
    "Instructions and input patterns are used to make the LLM plan actions and tool use is used to potentially\n",
    "carry out these actions. \n",
    "The ReAct pattern, a portmanteau of \"Reason + Act\", constructs an agent out of an LLM, using the LLM\n",
    "as a planner. The LLM is prompted to \"think out loud\". Specifically, the language model is prompted with\n",
    "a textual description of the environment, a goal, a list of possible actions, and a record of the actions and\n",
    "observations so far. It generates one or more thoughts before generating an action, which is then executed\n",

    "The Reflexion method constructs an agent that learns over multiple episodes. At the end of each\n",
    "episode, the LLM is given the record of the episode, and prompted to think up \"lessons learned\", which\n",
    "would help it perform better at a subsequent episode. These \"lessons learned\" are stored as a form of\n",
    "long-term memory and given to the agent in the subsequent episodes. \n",
    "Monte Carlo tree search can use an LLM as rollout heuristic. When a programmatic world model is not\n",
    "available, an LLM can also be prompted with a description of the environment to act as world model. \n",
    "For open-ended exploration, an LLM can be used to score observations for their \"interestingness\", which\n",
    "can be used as a reward signal to guide a normal (non-LLM) reinforcement learning agent. \n",
    "Alternatively, it can propose increasingly difficult tasks for curriculum learning. Instead of outputting\n",

    "LLMs are conventionally trained to generate an output without generating intermediate steps. As a result\n",
    "their performance tends to be subpar on complex questions requiring (at least in humans) intermediate\n",
    "steps of thought. This deficiency has been overcome by breaking down the tasks into smaller steps for the\n",
    "LLM either manually or automatically.\n",
    "The \"prompt chaining\" paradigm was published in 2021. In this method, a user manually breaks a\n",

    "what to do and some results from preceeding steps. The result from one step is then reused in a next step,\n",
    "until a final answer is reached. The ability of an LLM to follow instructions means that even non-experts\n",

    "A 2022 paper demonstrated a separate technique called \"Chain-of-Thought Prompting\", which makes the\n",
    "LLM break the question down autonomously. An LLM is given some examples where the \"assistant\"\n",
    "verbally breaks down the thought process before arriving at an answer. The LLM mimics these examples\n",
    "and also tries to spend some time generating intermediate steps before providing the final answer. This\n",
    "additional step elicited by prompting improves the correctness of the LLM on relatively complex\n",
    "questions. On math word questions, a prompted model can exceed even fine-tuned GPT-3 with a\n",
